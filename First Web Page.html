    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p>The exact origins of cricket are unknown, but some experts believe it was invented in England during Saxon or Norman times. 
        Some evidence suggests that cricket may have been played as early as the 13th century. The first recorded cricket match was in 1646 in Kent, England. The laws of cricket were established in 1744, and the world's first cricket club was formed in 1760. 
        Cricket is a bat and ball sport played by two teams on an oval. It involves batting, fielding, and bowling. 
        Cricket is most popular in former British colonies like India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Australia. </p>
